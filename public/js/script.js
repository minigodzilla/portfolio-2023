One of my first tasks was to work closely with the designers to develop rapid prototypes, which we used for user and stakeholder testing, internal demos and design review. A few of these prototypes are shown here.</p><p>Using a lightweight Node/SASS/JS tech stack, I produced high-fidelity prototypes to help realize a new look and feel for Diply's homepage, on both mobile and desktop, and helped refine the user flows and experience for their new self-publishing tools. I continued working on these interfaces and tools in the production environment, building and styling components in Angular for the final product.</p><p>Diply's new rapid iteration and prototype-driven design process enabled them to move quickly on experimental UI and evaluation, collecting feedback early in the process, and reducing the need for changes during development.

Around her house, and in the garden, are all the ingredients necessary to make her famous corn soup. Forage and collect all of the ingredients, and don't forget to find the recipe book too!</p><p>As you explore the level, you will come across corn and beans in the garden, wild strawberries in the woods, and much more. As you approach these items, the word for the item appears in Kanien'kéha.</p><p>By collecting all of the ingredients and the recipe book, you can learn how to make Mohawk corn soup, based on traditional recipes handed down over generations. Additional items found in the level, like strawberries, can unlock additional surprises!</p><p>The vision for this game was conceived during ImagineNATIVE's Land Jam game hackathon in June 2022. Myself and a team of others all happened to have roots in different Mohawk communities, which led us to think about ways to propagate and teach our language, culture and traditions to other Mohawks displaced from communities, especially children. The idea to create an educational children's adventure game was born.</p><p>I undertook a lot of learning to leverage my web development skill set for the new task of building a 3D game. This involved code review, tutorial consumption, experimentation and prototyping. What I couldn't fully develop on my own, I broke down into manageable tasks and enlisted help from some Unity developer friends and colleagues. In turn, I gleaned additional learning from reviewing the approaches they took and the code they wrote. I reached out to my partner Jenn to create some art for the characters and items in the game.</p><p>For more information or to download a demo of Onénhsto, visit the <a target='_blank' href='https://onenhsto.com/''>official website</a>.</p>",
